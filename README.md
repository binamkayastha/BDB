# BDB - Bash Debugger [In Progress]

Bash debugger for shell scripts out there suck, so I'm making a bash debugger, because scripting is hard without one.

The project is currently in progress, and will soon be open for contributions once the times in the todo file are completed.

# Todo
 - [ ] Retain shell information like environmental variables
 - [ ] Refactor
 - [ ] Write Unit tests
 - [ ] Create GPL license and copyright permissions
 - [ ] Create info on how others can contribute to the project
