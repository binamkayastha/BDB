# BDB - Bash Debugger [In Progress | Open for Contribution]

Bash debugger for shell scripts out there suck, so I'm making a bash debugger, because scripting is hard without one.

The project is currently in progress, and will soon be open for contributions once the times in the todo file are completed.

# Todo/Open for Contribution
 - [ ] Clean up code
 - [ ] Retain shell information like environmental variables
 - [ ] Write Unit tests
 - [ ] Create GPL license and copyright permissions
 - [ ] Change code so that it uses file descriptors instead of creating a new subprocess every new loop
 - [ ] Add various commands like, print, next, list, etc.
